# Password-to-Image: Because Why Not?

Welcome to **Password-to-Image**, the app you never knew you needed!

Please note, I am not a security expert. This project is for fun. I learned encryption just for ths project. Use at your own risk.

## What Does It Do?

Have you ever thought, "Hey, I want to store my passwords in an image!"? No? Well, too bad! This app does exactly that. It encrypts your passwords, converts them to binary, and saves them as a black-and-white image.

## Getting Started

1. **Run the app**: `go run main.go yourPassword`
2. **Set a Master Password:** You'll be prompted to set a master password on first run. This password will be used to encrypt all your other passwords, so make it a good one!
3. **Choose an Option:**
   - **a**: Add a password
   - **l**: List your passwords
   - **g**: Get a specific password

## Why Use This?

- **Because it's fun!**
- **Impress your friends**
- **Why not?**

## Important Notes

- **Don't lose your master password!** If you do, it's game over for your passwords.
- **Back up your image!** Keep it safe and sound.
